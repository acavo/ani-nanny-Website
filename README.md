Wouldn’t it be great to have a pet or taking care of one? We wanted to help people in Denmark find the perfect spot to have their pet’s taken care of without going to expensive hotels or pet shelters. For the ones who don’t have a pet, Are you willing to take care of a pet in the holidays? Our app allows owners- and pet-nannies to connect. You can create an account in minutes and chat with other users to set an appointment with our registered pet-nannies to have your furball taken care of as you would have. Plus we made it cheap! There is no more need to close your beloved ones in cages for days while you are away. It’s safe, reliable and life-changing. On the other hand if you love animals, you’re more than welcome to become a ‘pet nanny’ and give a temporary home to a furry friend. Ani-Nanny gives a great opportunity to both parties, who don’t need to worry ani-more.
